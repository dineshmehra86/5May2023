            <img src="./img/b5.png">
            <p>On Thursday morning, Delhi woke up to a blanket of fog enveloping the city, sending the mercury plunging to 15.8 degrees Celsius (°C), the lowest in 41 years. On Wednesday, it was nine degrees below the normal. On Tuesday, it was 11 degrees below the average in May. And on Monday, Delhi clocked a maximum temperature of 26.1°C, or 13 degrees below normal, in what was the city's coldest start to the month since at least 2011, as per the India Meteorological Department (IMD).</p>
            <p>The cooler climes, thanks to a western disturbance, have ensured that the weather office is not expecting a heatwave in the northern region till the second week of May. And while this aberration in the weather has brought relief to millions of residents, it may also hold an unwelcome portent for the upcoming monsoon, which is expected to be sapped of some energy by the Pacific-warming phenomenon El Nino.</p>

            <p>April's monthly collections for Goods and Services Tax (GST) - they track tax collections for the month of March - have come at an all-time high of ₹1.87 lakh crore. While part of the increase is just seasonality - March generally sees a higher tax collection because it is the last month in the fiscal year - it cannot be denied that the GST regime has overcome its initial teething troubles and revenue shortfall anxieties. HT reported on April 12 that the government is expecting GST collections for 2023-24 to cross the ₹20 trillion (lakh crore) mark.</p>

            <p>The court's step is important because it opens the door for divorce jurisprudence that does not hinge upon one partner finding fault with the other's conduct, or the allegations of violence, fraud or cruelty.</p>
            <p>In a significant shift away from the fault-based theory of divorce, a five-judge Constitution bench of the Supreme Court decided on Monday that it can dissolve a marriage on the grounds of irretrievable breakdown of relations exercising its powers under Article 142, which empowers the top court to pass any order that it deems necessary for complete justice in any matter pending before it.</p>
